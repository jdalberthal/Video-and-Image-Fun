# PowerShell Media & File Utilities

This is a collection of powerful, GUI-based PowerShell scripts designed for a variety of media and file management tasks. The suite includes tools for analyzing video corruption, extracting detailed file metadata, and displaying images and videos in unique, dynamic waysâ€”such as on a rotating 3D cube or in a continuous scroller.

The main entry point is `Show-ScriptLauncher.ps1`, which provides a user-friendly interface to discover and launch all other scripts in the collection, checking for dependencies and grouping them automatically.

## Features

- **Dynamic Script Launcher**: Automatically discovers and creates launch buttons for all scripts in its directory.
- **Video Corruption Analysis**: Scan video files for general corruption, container mismatches, and `moov atom` placement using FFmpeg.
- **Video Repair**: Attempt to repair corrupted video files by re-muxing, re-encoding, or fixing the `moov atom`.
- **Deep File Metadata Extraction**: Pulls detailed EXIF data from images and comprehensive shell properties from any file type.
- **3D Media Cube**: Display images or videos on the faces of an interactive, rotating 3D cube.
- **Continuous Media Scroller**: Create a seamless horizontal or vertical scrolling display of images and videos.
- **Flexible Video Playback**: Scripts are available in two flavors: one using **FFmpeg** for broad format support and another using the native Windows **MediaElement** for simplicity.
- **User-Friendly GUIs**: All tools are wrapped in intuitive graphical interfaces built with Windows Forms and WPF.
